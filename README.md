The term “core inflation” is widely used in discussions surrounding central banks’
conduction of monetary policy. However, it is not a common term in academic literature, as
there is no clear consensus on the definition of core inflation and the best way to measure
it (Wynne, 2008, p. 205). In line with this, he indicates the absence of a well-formulated
theory of what these measures should be capturing.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of relevant
literature for core inflation and their assessment methodologies. Section 3 presents the
evaluation of the core inflation indicators and their recalibration using the most recent data.
Section 4 presents statistical tests of their relationship to money supply growth and their
performance in forecasting future inflation. Section 5 presents some concluding remarks.
